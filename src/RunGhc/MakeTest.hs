module MakeTest where


-- simple tests that are monoidal and evaluate the validity of user input




-- NOTE: for generating an infinite stream, since we still do (Take n)
-- we can always write this to input.json (and maybe other places) so that
-- the user can do whatever they want
--
-- Could also be that we have inputs/1.json , inputs/2.json .. inputs/n.json
